The following project is "On The Run", a web application made for BattleHack Seattle. The idea is that a user pledges a certain amount of money to run supplied distance in a certain amount of time. If the user completes the goal, they get their money back. If they fail to complete their goal by the date specified, there money is given to a charity of their choice. The running is tracked using RunKeeper's API to pull in live actual running data to see if they have run the specified distance.
